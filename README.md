Massiverole Discord Script
To use the script, you first need to create a Discord bot and invite it to your server with the necessary permissions to manage roles. Then, replace "TOKEN" in the script with your bot's token and "ROLE NAME" with the name of the role you want to give to all members.

Once you have saved the modified script, run it and send the "!add_role" command in a channel where the bot has access. The script will then give the specified role to all members in the server and send a message confirming that the operation was successful.

Note: This script has the potential to give a role to a large number of members, so use it with caution and make sure you understand the consequences of the command before using it.
